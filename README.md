# Snake Game Repository

## Feature Branches

For modular development, the project is divided into:
- `ve-khung` - Draws the game frame
- `an-moi` - Implements fruit-eating functionality (current branch)
- `di-chuyen` - Handles snake movement
- `menu-score` - Manages menu and scoring
- `main` - Primary branch for tested features

## Current Branch: `an-moi`

### Fruit-Eating Implementation
- Generates fruit at random positions
- Detects snake-fruit collision
- Increases score and snake length
- Spawns new fruit after eating

ðŸ“Œ Note:  
This branch builds upon the base version with frame and movement. Ensure those are working before testing.

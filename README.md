# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `code-mau.exe` file (so it can render a C++ console), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

1. Clone git : gh repo clone Zapyvotri-prj-ss004-10/demo-repository

2. Build : Run Launch Code-mau.exe
## Branch Creation

For modular development and better code management, the project is divided into the following five feature branches:

- `ve-khung` – Responsible for drawing the game's frame or boundary
- `an-moi` – Implements the food-eating functionality for the snake
- `di-chuyen` – Handles the snake's movement controls and direction logic
- `menu-score` – Displays the menu and manages score tracking
- `main` – The primary branch used to merge all tested and completed features

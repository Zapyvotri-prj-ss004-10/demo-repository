# Branch `ve-khung` 

This branch focuses on **drawing the game frame (border)** for the Snake game in the console.

## Goals:
- Display a bordered frame (using `+` characters) around the game screen.
- Set up and align the width and height of the frame properly.
- Draw the frame in a clean and expandable way for future updates.

## Why a separate branch?
Separating the "draw frame" feature helps to:
- Easily test and refine the basic console interface.
- Debug layout and dimension issues without interference from other components.
- Build a solid foundation before adding more elements like the snake, score display, fruit, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Note:  
Run the program to make sure the frame is displayed correctly before moving on to the next stage
